# Customer-Segmentation-RFM-Analysis-Dashboard-Power-BI-
RFM analysis is used in a Power BI dashboard to categorize clients according to their purchase patterns. Through data-driven insights, it assists companies in identifying high-value clients, keeping at-risk ones, and optimizing marketing campaigns.

**Customer Segmentation & RFM Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)**

**Project Overview**

This project uses Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) analysis to create a data-driven system for client segmentation and behavior analysis. By classifying clients according to their purchasing patterns, the objective is to assist companies in maximizing their marketing plans, employee retention initiatives, and income production.A Power BI dashboard was created to offer interactive visualizations that offer practical insights into consumer behavior, allowing companies to increase sales, decrease attrition, and improve customer loyalty.

**Business Problem**

Businesses frequently have trouble understanding their clientele, which results in ineffective marketing initiatives, high attrition rates, and lost sales possibilities. Businesses lose money on uninteresting clients while ignoring valuable clients who could generate large profits if they don't properly segment their consumer base.

**Key Challenges:**

Finding devoted, high-value clients who generate steady income.
Identifying vulnerable clients before they leave.
Recognizing spending trends to develop tailored marketing plans.
Targeting the most value client categories to maximize marketing costs.
Solution: RFM-Based Customer Segmentation

An RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analytical methodology was used to address these issues. RFM analysis aids in client classification according to:

Recency (R): The time since a customer's last purchase.
Frequency (F): The number of times a customer buys.
Monetary Value (M): The amount of money spent by a client.
Businesses can adjust their marketing strategy by using these three variables to split customers into relevant categories like Champions, Loyal Customers, At Risk, and Lost Customers.

**Technology & Tools Used:**

Power BI – For data visualization and interactive dashboard creation.
SQL  – Used for preprocessing and RFM score calculation.
Excel / CSV Dataset – Used as the primary data source.
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Used for advanced calculations in Power BI.
Data Preparation & Processing

**1. Data Collection:**

Customer ID, purchase date, order frequency, and total expenditure were all gathered from the customer's transaction history.Excel, CSV, or a SQL database were the sources of the data.

**2. RFM Score Calculation:**

An RFM score was given to each client based on:

Recency Score => Higher score means more recent transactions.
Frequency Score → A higher score results from more frequent purchases.
Financial Score: Higher spending results in a higher score.
**3. Data Transformation (Power BI ):**

To calculate RFM values, calculated columns were made.To dynamically aggregate values, DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) algorithms were employed.For interactivity, slicers and filters were used.

**Key Features of the Power BI Dashboard**

**1. Customer Segmentation Overview**

A bar chart and tree map visualization were used to represent the customer categories.To comprehend the distribution, count the number of customers in each segment.analysis of market trends using a percentage breakdown of client segments.

**2. RFM Analysis Breakdown**

Days since the last purchase (analysis of recency)
The quantity of orders placed throughout the past 12 months (frequency analysis)
Segment-specific revenue (Monetary Analysis)

**3. Customer Segments & Actionable Strategies**

The dashboard offers thorough suggestions for every client category:

Champions (High R, F, and M): Described as recently purchased, frequently purchased, and most expensive.
Take action by rewarding them, introducing unique items, and using their word-of-mouth promotion.
Loyal Customers (High F, M; Medium R): Those that shop frequently and have a high spending threshold but may not be the newest customers.
Take action by providing individualized offers, loyalty plans, and premium product upselling.
Potential Loyalists (Medium R, High F, M): These are new clients who have made good purchases but haven't yet demonstrated loyalty.
Take action by making exclusive incentives to keep them and promote recurring business.
Customers at Risk (Low R, Medium F, M)
Definition: Clients who used to buy frequently but haven't done so recently.
Take action by sending re-engagement campaigns, customized emails, and targeted promotions.
Loss of Clients (Low R, F, M)
Long intervals between purchases indicate the least engaged clients.
Take action: Use seasonal specials or win-back efforts to rekindle interest.

**4. Interactive Visualizations & Filtering**

Businesses can evaluate data by time period, segment, or nation using dynamic filters.
Top-performing customer groups are highlighted by heatmaps and treemaps.
Comparison charts are useful for monitoring how customers shift between groups over time.
Business Impact & Benefits

A Higher Retention Rate of Customers: Businesses can reduce customer attrition by recognizing and interacting with at-risk clients early on.
Optimal Marketing Techniques: Aids in concentrating marketing efforts on valuable clients rather than squandering money on low-converting markets.
Increased Revenue and ROI: Businesses can successfully upsell and cross-sell because loyal consumers and champions generate more income.
Making Decisions Based on Data: Businesses may now leverage real-time analytics to enhance their customer interaction strategies rather than relying just on conjecture.

**Conclusion**

A thorough, data-driven method for comprehending consumer purchase behavior is offered by this Power BI-based customer segmentation project. Using RFM analysis, companies can:

Boost client retention
Optimize the effectiveness of marketing
Increase the lifetime value of customers
Boost company profitability
This initiative gives businesses the tools they need to make strategic, data-driven decisions for long-term success through interactive dashboards, dynamic filters, and deep insights.
